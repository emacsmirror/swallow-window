# swallow-window.el

See `swallow-window.el` for now; it's too much effort to maintain the
docs both here and in my elisp file. I'll get around to it.

Alternatively, check the `features/swallow-window.feature`; that explains
what works right now.

Real Docs Coming Soon(tm).

## Testing
This totally won't run on your machine yet. I need to get my fork
of ecukes into the upstream, to add support for scenario outlines.

## Credits
1. [Josh Cheek](https://github.com/JoshCheek) for writing
   [the original parser for window layouts](https://gist.github.com/4498756)
   that I use in my cukes. Without that, I never would've bothered
   working on this library.
